You can find the version number of the most recent CLI on the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster/releases)\.

In this guide, the command examples assume that you have Python v3 installed\. The `pip` command examples use the `pip3` version\.

## Installing AWS ParallelCluster in a virtual environment \(recommended\)<a name="install-tool-venv"></a>

We recommend that you install AWS ParallelCluster in a virtual environment\. If you encounter issues when you attempt to install AWS ParallelCluster with `pip3`, you can [install AWS ParallelCluster in a virtual environment](install-virtualenv.md) to isolate the tool and its dependencies\. Or you can use a different version of Python than you normally do\.

## Installing AWS ParallelCluster in a non\-virtual environment using pip<a name="install-tool-pip"></a>

The primary distribution method for AWS ParallelCluster on Linux, Windows, and macOS is `pip`, which is a package manager for Python\. It provides a way to install, upgrade, and remove Python packages and their dependencies\.

**Current AWS ParallelCluster Version**  
AWS ParallelCluster is updated regularly\. To determine whether you have the latest version, see the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster/releases)\.

If you already have `pip` and a supported version of Python, you can install AWS ParallelCluster by using the following command\. If you have Python version 3\+ installed, we recommend that you use the **pip3** command\.

```
$ pip3 install "aws-parallelcluster<3.0" --upgrade --user
```
