# Slurm guide for multiple queue mode<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3"></a>

Here you can learn how AWS ParallelCluster and Slurm manage queue \(partition\) nodes and how you can monitor the queue and node states\.

## Overview<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-overview"></a>

The scaling architecture is based on Slurmâ€™s [ Cloud Scheduling Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/elastic_computing.html) and power saving plugin\. For more information about the power saving plugin, see [Slurm Power Saving Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html)\. In the architecture, resources that can potentially be made available for a cluster are typically predefined in the Slurm configuration as cloud nodes\.

## Cloud node lifecycle<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-cloud-node-lifecycle"></a>

Throughout their lifecycle, cloud nodes enter several if not all of the following states: `POWER_SAVING`, `POWER_UP` \(`pow_up`\), `ALLOCATED` \(`alloc`\), and `POWER_DOWN` \(`pow_dn`\)\. In some cases, a cloud node might enter the `OFFLINE` state\. The following list details several aspects of these states in the cloud node lifecycle\.
+ **A node in a `POWER_SAVING` state** appears with a `~` suffix \(for example `idle~`\) in `sinfo`\. In this state, no EC2 instances are backing the node\. However, Slurm can still allocate jobs to the node\.
+ **A node transitioning to a `POWER_UP` state** appears with a `#` suffix \(for example `idle#`\) in `sinfo`\. A node automatically transitions to a `POWER_UP` state, when Slurm allocates a job to a node in a `POWER_SAVING` state\.

  Alternatively, nodes can be transitioned to the `POWER_UP` state manually with the `scontrol update nodename=nodename state=power_up` command\. In this stage, the `ResumeProgram` is invoked, EC2 instances are launched and configured, and the node transitions to the `POWER_UP` state\.
+ **A node that is currently available for use** appears without a suffix \(for example `idle`\) in `sinfo`\. After the node is set up and has joined the cluster, it becomes available to run jobs\. In this stage, the node is properly configured and ready for use\.

  As a general rule, we recommend that the number of EC2 instances be the same as the number of available nodes\. In most cases, static nodes are available after the cluster is created\.
+ **A node that is transitioning to a `POWER_DOWN` state** appears with a `%` suffix \(for example `idle%`\) in `sinfo`\. Dynamic nodes automatically enter the `POWER_DOWN` state after [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime)\. In contrast, static nodes in most cases aren't powered down\. However, nodes can be placed in the `POWER_DOWN` state manually with the `scontrol update nodename=nodename state=powering_down` command\. In this state, the instances associated with a node are terminated, and the node is set back to the `POWER_SAVING` state and available for use after [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime)\.

  The [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime) setting is saved to the Slurm configuration `SuspendTimeout` setting\.
+ **A node that is offline** appears with a `*` suffix \(for example `down*`\) in `sinfo`\. A node goes offline if the Slurm controller can't contact the node or if the static nodes are disabled and the backing instances are terminated\.

Consider the node states shown in the following `sinfo` example\.

```
$ sinfo

  spot*        up   infinite      2   idle spot-st-spotcompute2-[1-2]
```

The `spot-st-spotcompute2-[1-2]` and `efa-st-efacompute1-1` nodes already have backing instances set up and are available for use\. The `ondemand-dy-ondemandcompute1-[1-2]` nodes are in the `POWER_UP` state and should be available within a few minutes\. The `gpu-dy-gpucompute1-1` node is in the `POWER_DOWN` state, and it transitions into `POWER_SAVING` state after [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime) \(defaults to 10 minutes\)\.

All of the other nodes are in `POWER_SAVING` state with no EC2 instances backing them\.

## Working with an available node<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-working-with-available-nodes"></a>

An available node is backed by an EC2 instance\. By default, the node name can be used to directly SSH into the instance \(for example `ssh efa-st-efacompute1-1`\)\. The private IP address of the instance can be retrieved using the `scontrol show nodes nodename` command and checking the `NodeAddr` field\.

For nodes that aren't available, the `NodeAddr` field shouldn't point to a running EC2 instance\. Rather, it should be the same as the node name\.

## Job states and submission<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-job-states"></a>

Jobs submitted in most cases are immediately allocated to nodes in the system, or placed in pending if all the nodes are allocated\.

If nodes allocated for a job include any nodes in a `POWER_SAVING` state, the job starts out with a `CF`, or `CONFIGURING` state\. At this time, the job waits for the nodes in the `POWER_SAVING` state to transition to the `POWER_UP` state and become available\.

After all nodes allocated for a job are available, the job enters the `RUNNING` \(`R`\) state\.

By default, all jobs are submitted to the default queue \(known as a partition in Slurm\)\. This is signified by a `*` suffix after the queue name\. You can select a queue using the `-p` job submission option\.

All nodes are configured with the following features, which can be used in job submission commands:
+ An instance type \(for example `c5.xlarge`\)
+ A node type \(This is either `dynamic` or `static`\.\)

You can see the features for a particular node by using the `scontrol show nodes nodename` command and checking the `AvailableFeatures` list\.

Consider the initial state of the cluster, which you can view by running the `sinfo` command\.

```
$ sinfo

```

Note that `spot` is the default queue\. It is indicated by the `*` suffix\.

Submit a job to one static node in the default queue \(`spot`\)\.

```
$ sbatch --wrap "sleep 300" -N 1 -C static
```

Submit a job to one dynamic node in the `EFA` queue\.

```
$ sbatch --wrap "sleep 300" -p efa -C dynamic
```

Submit a job to eight \(8\) `c5.2xlarge` nodes and two \(2\) `t2.xlarge` nodes in the `ondemand` queue\.

```
$ sbatch --wrap "sleep 300" -p ondemand -N 10 -C "[c5.2xlarge*8&t2.xlarge*2]"
```

Submit a job to one GPU node in the `gpu` queue\.

```
$ sbatch --wrap "sleep 300" -p gpu -G 1
```

Consider the state of the jobs using the `squeue` command\.

```
$ squeue
 JOBID PARTITION    NAME   USER   ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  12   ondemand     wrap   ubuntu CF       0:36     10 ondemand-dy-ondemandcompute1-[1-8],ondemand-dy-ondemandcompute2-[1-2]

   8        efa     wrap   ubuntu  R       0:39      1 efa-dy-efacompute1-1
```

Jobs 7 and 8 \(in the `spot` and `efa` queues\) are already running \(`R`\)\. Jobs 12 and 13 are still configuring \(`CF`\), probably waiting for instances to become available\.

## Node state and features<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-node-state-features"></a>

In most cases, node states are fully managed by AWS ParallelCluster according to the specific processes in the cloud node lifecycle described earlier in this topic\.

However, AWS ParallelCluster also replaces or terminates unhealthy nodes in `DOWN` and `DRAINED` states and nodes that have unhealthy backing instances\. For more information, see [`clustermgtd`](processes-v3.md#clustermgtd-v3)\.

## Partition states<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-partition-states"></a>

AWS ParallelCluster supports the following partition states\. A Slurm partition is a queue in AWS ParallelCluster\.
+ `UP`: Indicates that the partition is in an active state\. This is the default state of a partition\. In this state, all nodes in the partition are active and available for use\.
+ `INACTIVE`: Indicates that the partition is in the inactive state\. In this state, all instances backing nodes of an inactive partition are terminated\. New instances aren't launched for nodes in an inactive partition\.

## pcluster update\-compute\-fleet<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-pcluster-update-compute-fleet"></a>
+ **Stopping the compute fleet** \- When the following command is executed, all partitions transition to the `INACTIVE` state, and AWS ParallelCluster processes keep the partitions in the `INACTIVE` state\.

  ```
  $ pcluster update-compute-fleet --cluster-name testSlurm \
     --region eu-west-1 --status STOP_REQUESTED
  ```
+ **Starting the compute fleet** \- When the following command is executed, all partitions initially transition to the `UP` state\. However, AWS ParallelCluster processes don't keep the partition in an `UP` state\. You need to change partition states manually\. All static nodes become available after a few minutes\. Note that setting a partition to `UP` doesn't power up any dynamic capacity\.

  ```
  $ pcluster update-compute-fleet --cluster-name testSlurm \
     --region eu-west-1 --status START_REQUESTED
  ```

When `update-compute-fleet` is run, you can check the state of the cluster by running the `pcluster describe-compute-fleet` command and checking the `Status`\. The following lists possible states:
+ `STOP_REQUESTED`: The stop compute fleet request is sent to the cluster\.
+ `STOPPING`: The `pcluster` process is currently stopping the compute fleet\.
+ `STOPPED`: The `pcluster` process finished the stopping process, all partitions are in `INACTIVE` state, and all compute instances are terminated\.
+ `START_REQUESTED`: The start compute fleet request is sent to the cluster\.
+ `STARTING`: The `pcluster` process is currently starting the cluster\.
+ `RUNNING`: The `pcluster` process finished the starting process, all partitions are in the `UP` state, and static nodes are available after a few minutes\.
+  `PROTECTED`: This status indicates that some partitions have consistent bootstrap failures\. Affected partitions are inactive\. Please investigate the issue and then run `update-compute-fleet` to re\-enable the fleet\.

## Manual control of queues<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-manual-control-queue"></a>

In some cases, you might want to have some manual control over the nodes or queue \(known as a partition in Slurm\) in a cluster\. You can manage nodes in a cluster through the following common procedures\.
+ **Power up dynamic nodes in `POWER_SAVING` state**

   Run the `scontrol update nodename=nodename state=power_up` command or submit a placeholder `sleep 1` job requesting a certain number of nodes and then rely on Slurm to power up the required number of nodes\.
+ **Power down dynamic nodes before [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime)**

  We recommend that you set dynamic nodes to `DOWN` with the `scontrol update nodename=nodename state=down` command\. AWS ParallelCluster automatically terminates and resets the downed dynamic nodes\.

  In general, we don't recommend that you set nodes to `POWER_DOWN` directly using the `scontrol update nodename=nodename state=power_down` command\. This is because AWS ParallelCluster automatically handles the power down process\.
+ **Disable a queue \(partition\) or stop all static nodes in specific partition**

  Set a specific queue to `INACTIVE` with the `scontrol update partition=queuename state=inactive` command\. Doing this terminates all instances backing nodes in the partition\.
+ **Enable a queue \(partition\)**

  Set a specific queue to `UP` with the `scontrol update partition=queuename state=up` command\.

## Scaling behavior and adjustments<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-scaling-behavior"></a>

**Here is an example of the normal scaling workflow:**
+ The scheduler receives a job that requires two nodes\.
+ The scheduler transitions two nodes to a `POWER_UP` state, and calls `ResumeProgram` with the node names \(for example `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-[1-2]`\)\.
+ `ResumeProgram` launches two EC2 instances and assigns the private IP addresses and hostnames of `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-[1-2]`, waiting for `ResumeTimeout` \(the default period is 30 minutes before resetting the nodes\.
+ Instances are configured and join the cluster\. A job starts running on instances\.
+ The job completes and stops running\.
+ After the configured `SuspendTime` has elapsed \(which is set to [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime)\), the scheduler sets the instances to the `POWER_SAVING` state\. The scheduler then sets `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-[1-2]` to the `POWER_DOWN` state and calls `SuspendProgram` with the node names\.
+ `SuspendProgram` is called for two nodes\. Nodes remain in the `POWER_DOWN` state, for example, by remaining `idle%` for a `SuspendTimeout` \(the default period is 120 seconds \(2 minutes\)\)\. After `clustermgtd` detects that nodes are powering down, it terminates the backing instances\. Then, it transitions `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-[1-2]` to the idle state and resets the private IP address and hostname so it is ready to power up for future jobs\.

**If things go wrong and an instance for a particular node can't be launched for some reason, then the following happens:**
+ The scheduler receives a job that requires two nodes\.
+ The scheduler transitions two cloud bursting nodes to the `POWER_UP` state and calls `ResumeProgram` with the nodenames, \(for example `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-[1-2]`\)\.
+ `ResumeProgram` launches only one \(1\) EC2 instance and configures `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-1`, with one \(1\) instance, `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-2`, failing to launch\.
+ `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-1` isn't impacted and comes online after reaching the `POWER_UP` state\.
+ `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-2` transitions to the `POWER_DOWN` state, and the job is requeued automatically because Slurm detects a node failure\.
+ `queue1-dy-spotcompute1-2` becomes available after `SuspendTimeout` \(the default is 120 seconds \(2 minutes\)\)\. In the meantime, the job is requeued and can start running on another node\.
+ The above process repeats until the job can run on an available node without a failure occurring\.

**There are two timing parameters that can be adjusted if needed:**
+ **`ResumeTimeout` \(the default is 30 minutes\)**: `ResumeTimeout` controls the time Slurm waits before transitioning the node to the down state\.
  + It might be useful to extend `ResumeTimeout` if your pre/post installation process takes nearly that long\.
  + `ResumeTimeout` is also the maximum time that AWS ParallelCluster waits before replacing or resetting a node if there is an issue\. Compute nodes self\-terminate if any error occurs during launch or setup\. AWS ParallelCluster processes replace a node upon detection of a terminated instance\.
+ **`SuspendTimeout` \(the default is 120 seconds \(2 minutes\)\)**: `SuspendTimeout` controls how quickly nodes get placed back into the system and are ready for use again\.
  + A shorter `SuspendTimeout` means that nodes are reset more quickly, and Slurm can try to launch instances more frequently\.
  + A longer `SuspendTimeout` means that failed nodes are reset more slowly\. In the meantime, Slurm tries to use other nodes\. If `SuspendTimeout` is more than a few minutes, Slurm tries to cycle through all nodes in the system\. A longer `SuspendTimeout` might be beneficial for large\-scale systems \(over1,000 nodes\) to reduce stress on Slurm when it tries to frequently re\-queue failing jobs\.
  + Note that `SuspendTimeout` doesn't refer to the time AWS ParallelCluster waits to terminate a backing instance for a node\. Backing instances for `POWER_DOWN` nodes are immediately terminated\. The terminate process usually is finished in a few minutes\. However, during this time, the node remains in the `POWER_DOWN` state and isn't available for the scheduler's use\.

## Logs for the architecture<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-logs"></a>

The following list contains the key logs\. The log stream name used with Amazon CloudWatch Logs has the format `{hostname}.{instance_id}.{logIdentifier}`, where *logIdentifier* follows the log names\.  
+ `ResumeProgram`: `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_resume.log` \(`slurm_resume`\)
+ `SuspendProgram`: `/var/log/parallelcluster/slurm_suspend.log` \(`slurm_suspend`\)
+ `clustermgtd`: `/var/log/parallelcluster/clustermgtd.log` \(`clustermgtd`\)
+ `computemgtd`: `/var/log/parallelcluster/computemgtd.log` \(`computemgtd`\)
+ `slurmctld`: `/var/log/slurmctld.log` \(`slurmctld`\)
+ `slurmd`: `/var/log/slurmd.log` \(`slurmd`\)

## Common issues and how to debug:<a name="multiple-queue-mode-slurm-user-guide-v3-common-issues"></a>

**Nodes that failed to launch, power up, or join the cluster**
+ Dynamic nodes:
  + Check the `ResumeProgram` log to see if `ResumeProgram` was called with the node\. If not, check the `slurmctld` log to determine if Slurm tried to call `ResumeProgram` with the node\. Note that incorrect permissions on `ResumeProgram` might cause it to fail silently\.
  + If `ResumeProgram` is called, check to see if an instance was launched for the node\. If the instance didn't launch, there should be clear error message as to why the instance failed to launch\.
  + If an instance was launched, there may have been some problem during the bootstrap process\. Find the corresponding private IP address and instance ID from the `ResumeProgram` log and look at corresponding bootstrap logs for the specific instance in CloudWatch Logs\.
+ Static nodes:
  + Check the `clustermgtd` log to see if instances were launched for the node\. If instances didn't launch, there should be clear errors on why the instances failed to launch\.
  + If an instance was launched, there is some problem with the bootstrap process\. Find the corresponding private IP and instance ID from the `clustermgtd` log and look at corresponding bootstrap logs for the specific instance in CloudWatch Logs\.

**Nodes replaced or terminated unexpectedly, and node failures**
+ Nodes replaced/terminated unexpectedly:
  + In most cases, `clustermgtd` handles all node maintenance actions\. To check if `clustermgtd` replaced or terminated a node, check the `clustermgtd` log\.
  + If `clustermgtd` replaced or terminated the node, there should be a message indicating the reason for the action\. If the reason is scheduler related \(for example, the node was `DOWN`\), check in the `slurmctld` log for more details\. If the reason is EC2 related, use tools such as Amazon CloudWatch or the AWS EC2 console, CLI, or SDKs, to check status or logs for that instance\. For example, you can check if the instance had scheduled events or failed EC2 health status checks\.
  + If `clustermgtd` didn't terminate the node, check if `computemgtd` terminated the node or if EC2 terminated the instance to reclaim a Spot Instance\.
+ Node failures:
  + In most cases, jobs are automatically requeued if a node failed\. Look in the `slurmctld` log to see why a job or a node failed and assess the situation from there\.

**Failure when replacing or terminating instances, failure when powering down nodes**
+ In general, `clustermgtd` handles all expected instance termination actions\. Look in the `clustermgtd` log to see why it failed to replace or terminate a node\.
+ For dynamic nodes failing [`ScaledownIdletime`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmSettings-ScaledownIdletime), look in the `SuspendProgram` log to see if `slurmctld` processes made calls with the specific node as argument\. Note `SuspendProgram` doesn't actually perform any specific action\. Rather, it only logs when itâ€™s called\. All instance termination and `NodeAddr` resets are completed by `clustermgtd`\. Slurm transitions nodes to `IDLE` after `SuspendTimeout`\.

**Other issues:**
+ AWS ParallelCluster doesn't make job allocation or scaling decisions\. It only tries to launch, terminate, and maintain resources according to Slurmâ€™s instructions\.

  For issues regarding job allocations, node allocation and scaling decision, look at the `slurmctld` log for errors\.
