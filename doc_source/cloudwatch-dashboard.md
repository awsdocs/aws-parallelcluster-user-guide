# Amazon CloudWatch dashboard<a name="cloudwatch-dashboard"></a>

Starting with AWS ParallelCluster version 2\.10\.0, an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard is created when the cluster is created\. This makes it easier to monitor the nodes in your cluster, and to view the logs stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. The name of the dashboard is `parallelcluster-ClusterName-Region`\. *ClusterName* is the name of your cluster and *Region* is the AWS Region of the cluster\. You can access the dashboard in the console, or by opening `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=Region#dashboards:name=parallelcluster-ClusterName`\.

The following image shows and example CloudWatch dashboard for a cluster\.

The first section of the dashboard displays graphs of the Head Node EC2 metrics\. If your cluster has shared storage, the next section shows shared storage metrics\. The final section lists Head Node Logs grouped by ParallelCluster's logs, Scheduler's logs, NICE DCV integration logs, and System's logs\.

For more information about Amazon CloudWatch dashboards, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

If you donâ€™t want to create the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard, you must complete these steps: First, add a [`[dashboard]` section](dashboard-section.md) to your configuration file, and then add the name of that section as the value of the [`dashboard_settings`](cluster-definition.md#dashboard-settings) setting in your [`[cluster]` section](cluster-definition.md)\. In your [`[dashboard]` section](dashboard-section.md), set ``enable` = false`\.

For example, if your [`[dashboard]` section](dashboard-section.md) is named `myDashboard` and your [`[cluster]` section](cluster-definition.md) is named `myCluster`, your changes resemble this\.

```
[cluster MyCluster]
dashboard_settings = MyDashboard
...

[dashboard MyDashboard]
enable = false
```
