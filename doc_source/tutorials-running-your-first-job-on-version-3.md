# Running your first job on AWS ParallelCluster<a name="tutorials-running-your-first-job-on-version-3"></a>

This tutorial walks you through running your first Hello World job on AWS ParallelCluster

**Prerequisites**
+ AWS ParallelCluster [is installed](install-v3-parallelcluster.md)\.
+ The AWS CLI [is installed and configured\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
+ You have an [EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)\.
+ You have an IAM role with the [permissions](iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.md#iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3-example-user-policies) required to run the [`pcluster`](pcluster-v3.md) CLI\.

## Verifying your installation<a name="tutorial-1stjob-verify-install"></a>

 First, we verify that AWS ParallelCluster is correctly, including the Node\.js dependency, installed and configured\. 

```
$ node --version
v16.8.0
$ pcluster version
{
  "version": "3.3.0"
}
```

This returns the running version of AWS ParallelCluster\.

## Creating your first cluster<a name="tutorial-1stjob-first-cluster"></a>

Now it's time to create your first cluster\. Because the workload for this tutorial isn't performance intensive, we can use the default instance size of `t2.micro`\. \(For production workloads, you choose an instance size that best fits your needs\.\) Let's call your cluster `hello-world`\.

```
$ pcluster create-cluster \
    --cluster-name hello-world \
    --cluster-configuration hello-world.yaml
```

**Note**  
The AWS Region to use must be specified for most `pcluster` commands\. If it's not specified in the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable, or the `region` setting in the `[default]` section of the `~/.aws/config` file, then the `--region` parameter must be provided on the `pcluster` command line\.

If the output gives you a message about configuration, you need to run the following to configure AWS ParallelCluster: 

```
$ pcluster configure --config hello-world.yaml
```

 If the [`pcluster create-cluster`](pcluster.create-cluster-v3.md) command succeeds, you see output similar to the following: 

```
{
  "cluster": {
    "clusterName": "hello-world",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:xxx:stack/xxx",
    "region": "...",
    "version": "...",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"
  }
}
```

 You monitor the creation of the cluster using: 

```
$ pcluster describe-cluster --cluster-name hello-world
```

 The `clusterStatus` reports "`CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`" while the cluster is being created\. The `clusterStatus` transitions to "`CREATE_COMPLETE`" when the cluster is created successfully\. The output also provides us with the `publicIpAddress` and `privateIpAddress` of our head node\.

## Logging into your head node<a name="tutorial-1stjob-logging-in-head-node"></a>

 Use your OpenSSH pem file to log into your head node\. 

```
$ pcluster ssh --cluster-name hello-world -i /path/to/keyfile.pem
```

 After you log in, run the command `sinfo` to verify that your compute nodes are set up and configured\. 

```
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
queue1*      up   infinite     10  idle~ queue1-dy-queue1t2micro-[1-10]
```

 The output shows that we have one queue in our cluster, with up to ten nodes\. 

## Running your first job using Slurm<a name="tutorial-1stjob-first-slurm-job"></a>

Next, we create a job that sleeps for a little while and then outputs its own hostname\. Create a file called `hellojob.sh`, with the following contents\.

```
#!/bin/bash
sleep 30
echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
```

 Next, submit the job using `sbatch`, and verify that it runs\. 

```
$ sbatch hellojob.sh
Submitted batch job 2
```

 Now, you can view your queue and check the status of the job\. The provisioning of a new Amazon EC2 instance is started in the background\. You can monitor the status of the cluster instances with the `sinfo` command\.

```
$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
                 2    queue1 hellojob ec2-user CF       3:30      1 queue1-dy-queue1t2micro-1
```

 The output shows that the job has been submitted to `queue1`\. Wait 30 seconds for the job to finish, and then run `squeue` again\. 

```
$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
```

 Now that there are no jobs in the queue, we can check for output in our current directory\. 

```
$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 57 Sep  1 14:25 hellojob.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 43 Sep  1 14:30 slurm-2.out
```

 In the output, we see a "`out`" file\. We can see output from our job: 

```
$ cat slurm-2.out
Hello World from queue1-dy-queue1t2micro-1
```

The output also shows that our job ran successfully on instance `queue1-dy-queue1t2micro-1`\.

In the cluster you just created, only the home directory is shared among all nodes of the cluster\.

To learn more about creating and using clusters, see [Best practices](best-practices-v3.md)\.

If your application requires shared software, libraries, or data, consider the following options:
+ Build a AWS ParallelCluster enabled custom AMI that includes your software as described in [Building a Custom AWS ParallelCluster AMI](building-custom-ami-v3.md)\.
+ Use the [StorageSettings](SharedStorage-v3.md) option in the AWS ParallelCluster configuration file to specify a shared filesystem and store your installed software in the specified mount location\.
+ Use [Custom bootstrap actions](custom-bootstrap-actions-v3.md) to automate the bootstrap procedure of each node of your cluster\.
