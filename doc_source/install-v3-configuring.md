# Configuring AWS ParallelCluster<a name="install-v3-configuring"></a>

After you install AWS ParallelCluster, complete the following configuration steps\.

Verify that your AWS Account has a role that includes the permissions needed to run the [`pcluster`](pcluster-v3.md) CLI\. For more information, see [AWS ParallelCluster example user policies](iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.md#iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3-example-user-policies)\.

Set up your AWS credentials\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) in the *AWS CLI user guide*\.

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]:
```

The AWS Region where the cluster is launched must have at least one Amazon EC2 key pair\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

```
$ pcluster configure --config cluster-config.yaml
```

The configure wizard prompts you for all of the information that's required to create your cluster\. The details of the sequence differ when using AWS Batch as the scheduler compared to using Slurm\.

------
#### [ Slurm ]

From the list of valid AWS Region identifiers, choose the Region where you want your cluster to run\.

**Note**  
The list of Regions shown is based on the partition of your account, and only includes Regions that are enabled for your account\. For more information about enabling Regions for your account, see [Managing AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\. The example shown is from the AWS Global partition\. If your account is in the AWS GovCloud \(US\) partition, only Regions in that partition are listed \(`gov-us-east-1` and `gov-us-west-1`\)\. Similarly, if your account is in the AWS China partition, only `cn-north-1` and `cn-northwest-1` are shown\. For the complete list of Regions supported by AWS ParallelCluster, see [Supported Regions for AWS ParallelCluster version 3](supported-regions-v3.md)\.

```
Allowed values for AWS Region ID:
1. af-south-1
2. ap-east-1
3. ap-northeast-1
4. ap-northeast-2

```

The key pair is selected from the key pairs that are registered with Amazon EC2 in the selected Region\. Choose the key pair:

```
Allowed values for EC2 Key Pair Name:
1. your-key-1
2. your-key-2
EC2 Key Pair Name [your-key-1]:
```

Choose the scheduler to use with your cluster\.

```
Allowed values for Scheduler:
1. slurm
2. awsbatch
Scheduler [slurm]:
```

Choose the operating system\.

```
Allowed values for Operating System:
1. alinux2
2. centos7
3. ubuntu1804
4. ubuntu2004
Operating System [alinux2]:
```

Choose head node instance type:

```
Head node instance type [t2.micro]:
```

Choose the queue configuration\. Note: Instance type can't be specified for multiple compute resources in the same queue\.

```
Number of queues [1]:
Name of queue 1 [queue1]:
Number of compute resources for queue1 [1]: 2
Compute instance type for compute resource 1 in queue1 [t2.micro]:
Maximum instance count [10]:
```

Enable EFA to run applications that require high levels of inter\-instance communication at scale on AWS at no additional charge:
+ Choose an instance type that [supports Elastic Fabric Adapter \(EFA\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html#efa-instance-types)\.
+ Enable [EFA](efa-v3.md)\.
+ Specify an existing [Placement Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) name\. If you leave it blank, AWS ParallelCluster creates one for you\.

```
Compute instance type for compute resource 2 in queue1 [t2.micro]: c5n.18xlarge
Enable EFA on c5n.18xlarge (y/n) [y]: y
Maximum instance count [10]:
Placement Group name []:
```

After the previous steps are completed, decide whether to use an existing VPC or let AWS ParallelCluster create a VPC for you\. If you don't have a properly configured VPC, AWS ParallelCluster can create a new one\. It either uses both the head and compute nodes in the same public subnet, or only the head node in a public subnet with all nodes in a private subnet\. It's possible to reach your quota for the number of VPCs allowed in a Region\. The default quota is five VPCs for a Region\. For more information about this quota and how to request an increase, see [VPC and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

If you let AWS ParallelCluster create a VPC, you must decide if all nodes should be in a public subnet\.

**Important**  
VPCs created by AWS ParallelCluster do not enable VPC Flow Logs by default\. VPC Flow Logs enable you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPCs\. For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

------

When you have completed the preceding steps, a simple cluster launches into a VPC\. The VPC uses an existing subnet that supports public IP addresses\. The route table for the subnet is `0.0.0.0/0 => igw-xxxxxx`\. Note the following conditions:
+ The VPC must have `DNS Resolution = yes` and `DNS Hostnames = yes`\.
+ The VPC must also have DHCP options with the correct `domain-name` for the Region\. The default DHCP Option Set already specifies the required AmazonProvidedDNS\. If specifying more than one domain name server, see [DHCP options sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. When using private subnets, use a NAT gateway or an internal proxy to enable web access for compute nodes\. For more information, see [Network configurations](network-configuration-v3.md)\.

When all settings contain valid values, you can launch the cluster by running the create command\.

```
$ pcluster create-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster --cluster-configuration cluster-config.yaml
{
  "cluster": {
    "clusterName": "test-cluster",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:xxx:stack/test-cluster/abcdef0-f678-890a-5abc-021345abcdef",
    "region": "eu-west-1",
    "version": "3.2.0",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"
  },
  "validationMessages": []
}
```

 Follow cluster progress: 

```
$ pcluster describe-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster
```

 or 

```
$ pcluster list-clusters --query 'clusters[?clusterName==`test-cluster`]'
```

After the cluster reaches the `"clusterStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"` status, you can connect to it by using your normal SSH client settings\. For more information about connecting to Amazon EC2 instances, see the [EC2 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. Or you can connect the cluster through 

```
$ pcluster ssh --cluster-name test-cluster -i ~/path/to/keyfile.pem
```

To delete the cluster, run the following command\.

```
$ pcluster delete-cluster --region us-east-1 --cluster-name test-cluster
```

After the cluster is deleted, you can delete the network resources in the VPC by deleting the CloudFormation networking stack\. The stack's name starts with "parallelclusternetworking\-" and contains the creation time in "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" format\. You can list the stacks using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/cloudformation-2010-05-15/ListStacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/cloudformation-2010-05-15/ListStacks) command\.

```
$ aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation list-stacks \
   --stack-status-filter "CREATE_COMPLETE" \
   --query "StackSummaries[].StackName" | \
   grep -e "parallelclusternetworking-"
   "parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20191029205804"
```

 The stack can be deleted using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/cloudformation-2010-05-15/DeleteStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/cloudformation-2010-05-15/DeleteStack) command\.

```
$ aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation delete-stack \
   --stack-name parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20191029205804
```

The VPC that [`pcluster configure`](pcluster.configure-v3.md) creates for you *isn't* created in the CloudFormation networking stack\. You can delete that VPC manually in the console or by using the AWS CLI\.

```
$ aws --region us-east-1 ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id vpc-0b4ad9c4678d3c7ad
```
