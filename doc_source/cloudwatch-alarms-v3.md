# Amazon CloudWatch alarms for cluster metrics<a name="cloudwatch-alarms-v3"></a>

Starting with AWS ParallelCluster version 3\.6, you can configure your cluster with Amazon CloudWatch alarms for monitoring the head node\. One alarm monitors the root volume `disk_used_percent`\. The other alarm monitors the `mem_used_percent` metric\. For more information, see [Metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**The alarms are named as follows:**
+ `cluster-name_DiskAlarm_HeadNode`
+ `cluster-name_MemAlarm_HeadNode`

*cluster\-name* is the name of your cluster\.

Access the alarms in the CloudWatch console by choosing **Alarms** in the navigation pane\. The following images show the disk usage alarm and memory usage alarm for a cluster\.

 ![\[A graph of the memory usage alarm status.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/images/CW-dash-alarm-mem.png) 

The disk usage alarm is in the `ALARM` state when the disk usage percentage is greater than 90% for 1 data point, within a 1 minute time period\.

The memory usage alarm is in the `ALARM` state when the memory usage percentage is greater than 90% for 1 data point, within a 1 minute time period\.

**Note**  
AWS ParallelCluster doesn't configure alarm actions by default\. For information about how to set up alarm actions, such as sending notifications, see [Alarm actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-actions)\. For more information about Amazon CloudWatch alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

If you donâ€™t want to create these Amazon CloudWatch alarms, deactivate them by setting [`Monitoring`](Monitoring-v3.md) / [`Dashboards`](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Dashboards) / [`CloudWatch`](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Dashboard-CloudWatch) / [`Enabled`](Monitoring-v3.md#yaml-Monitoring-Dashboard-CloudWatch-Enabled) to `false` in the cluster configuration\. This also disables the creation of the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch dashboard](cloudwatch-dashboard-v3.md)\.

**Note**  
If you deactivate the creation of the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard, you also deactivate the Amazon CloudWatch `disk_used_percent` and `memory_used_percent` alarms for your cluster\.
