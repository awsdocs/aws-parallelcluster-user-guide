# Placement groups and instance launch issues<a name="troubleshooting-v3-placemment-groups"></a>

To get the lowest inter\-node latency, use a *placement group*\. A placement group ensures that your instances are on the same networking backbone\. If there aren't enough instances available when a request is made, an `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` error is returned\. To reduce the possibility of receiving this error when using cluster placement groups, set the [`SlurmQueues`](Scheduling-v3.md#Scheduling-v3-SlurmQueues) / [`Networking`](Scheduling-v3.md#Scheduling-v3-SlurmQueues-Networking) / [`PlacementGroup`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmQueues-Networking-PlacementGroup) / [`Enabled`](Scheduling-v3.md#yaml-Scheduling-SlurmQueues-Networking-PlacementGroup-Enabled) parameter to `false`\.

For additional control over capacity access, consider [launching instances with ODCR \(On\-Demand Capacity Reservations\)](launch-instances-odcr-v3.md)\.
