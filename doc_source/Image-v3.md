`CustomAmi` \(**Optional**, `String`\)  
Specifies the ID of a custom AMI to use for the head and compute nodes instead of the default AMI\. For more information, see [AWS ParallelCluster AMI customization](custom-ami-v3.md)\.  
If the custom AMI requires additional permissions for its launch, these permissions must be added to both the user and head node policies\.  
For example, if a custom AMI has an encrypted snapshot associated with it, the following additional policies are required in both the user and head node policies:  

```
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
               "kms:DescribeKey",
               "kms:ReEncrypt*",
               "kms:CreateGrant",
               "kms:Decrypt"
           ],
           "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:kms:<AWS_REGION>:<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:key/<AWS_KMS_KEY_ID>"
           ]                                                    
       }
   ]
}
```
