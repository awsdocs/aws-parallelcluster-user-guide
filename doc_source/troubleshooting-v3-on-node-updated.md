# Cluster update failed on `onNodeUpdated` custom action<a name="troubleshooting-v3-on-node-updated"></a>

When a [`HeadNode`](HeadNode-v3.md) / [`CustomActions`](HeadNode-v3.md#HeadNode-v3-CustomActions) / [`OnNodeUpdated`](HeadNode-v3.md#yaml-HeadNode-CustomActions-OnNodeUpdated) script fails, the update fails and the script is not run at rollback time\. It's your responsibility to manually perform the cleanups needed after the rollback is completed\. For example, if the `OnNodeUpdated` script changes the status of a field in a configuration file \(for example, from `true` to `false`\) and then fails, you need to manually restore that field value to the pre\-update state \(for example, `false` to `true`\)\. For more information, see [Custom bootstrap actions](custom-bootstrap-actions-v3.md)\.
